# Django Trainee Assignment — Accuknox

This repository contains proof-based answers for the Django Signals and Python Custom Class tasks.

## Topics Covered

### Django Signals
1. **Synchronous Execution Proof** — `signals_sync_test.py`
2. **Same Thread Execution Proof** — `signals_thread_test.py`
3. **Same Database Transaction Proof** — `signals_transaction_test.py`

Each file contains:
- The signal definition
- A test function (`run_test()`)
- Expected output showing the conclusion

### Python Custom Class
- **File:** `rectangle_class.py`
- Implements an iterable Rectangle class yielding `{'length': ...}` and `{'width': ...}`

## How to Run
You can integrate these scripts into a simple Django project or run them interactively in Django shell after connecting signals.
